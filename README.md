#README
The following will be a written summary of our project including, mission, motivation, logistics, and limitations

#mission
In the upcoming world of online learning, it will be crucial for the students to maintain their drive and self motivation in order to excel in their studies. Without constant supervision, it will be up to the students personal resolve in order to complete their coursework. In order to boost their motivation, Mentr aims to connect students with an older peer to help them get excited for their future. 

#motivation
With the world of online learning, the drive students need to succeed needs to be almost fully self-driven. We believe that an inspiring mentor would show the students that their efforts in academia are not in vain and will help them reach their full potential and goals. The concept of belief based utility is not a new one, where students need to see success in someone who looks like them, has gone through similar experiences as them, and understands them in order to take advantage of the opportunities before them. Without belief based utility, students will likely pass up countless opportunities because they have never seen someone similar to them succeed by taking them. We would hope that our mentor program will allow these students to connect to someone who can inspire them to learn and show them the real value of their education. 

#logistics
Mentees will be limited to middle and high school students and mentors will be limited to high school and college students. 

Since this is an application that involves minors, we understand that there might be a push back from parents regarding the safety of their child. We believe that through a through vetting process, Mentr would be able to ensure the quality of our mentors as well as the safety of the students. 
In practice, Mentr’s mentor acquisition program would start with a simple background check as well as a thorough interview process. If we believe the mentor to be a good fit, we will then have them complete a 1 week bootcamp to train them in their dealing with children, in terms of communications and overall interactions. This process aims to ensure that the mentors do not abuse their positions with the mentee and have the best interests of the mentee at heart. 

#limitations
As for any project, it is important to note our personal limitations in order to ensure we provide the best product possible. Since our interface is in the form of an application, there is already a disparity between students who will have access to the resource and students who may not. Since this “Homework Gap” is already very prevalent in the lives of underprivileged students, we would hope to gain enough usage that we can reach out to teachers and administration to endorse our use. With their support, we would be able to reach students who usually would not think to engage in a program such as ours. 

We hope that by introducing younger students to older students who can empathize with their experiences and struggles, we can show them that their education can be fun and exciting and hope to inspire them to work hard through their current circumstances.  

Mentr - where students can learn how fun learning can be!
